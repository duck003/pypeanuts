For the decomposition diagram, include each implemented class with their properties and methods and draw arrows between classes that interact with eachother. Draw by hand first. You can take a picture and add it to your page. If you want to draw the diagram digitally, you can use [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) or any other software of your choice. Here is a [template](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1L7rig3DPeSpGgIQCM0IddXcho81k86jn) which you can use.
